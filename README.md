Clustering:

    -Clustering is an unsupervised machine learning technique used to group similar data points together based on patterns or similarities in their features. 
    -The goal of clustering is to divide a dataset into meaningful clusters where points in the same cluster are more similar to each other than to those in other clusters.

Types of Clustering Algorithms:

    1)K-Means Clustering: 
          – Divides data into K predefined clusters by minimizing the distance between points and their assigned cluster center.
    2)Hierarchical Clustering:
          – Builds a tree-like hierarchy of clusters using a bottom-up (agglomerative) or top-down (divisive) approach.
    3)DBSCAN (Density-Based Spatial Clustering of Applications with Noise):
          – Groups data points based on density, useful for discovering clusters of varying shapes.
    4)Gaussian Mixture Model (GMM) :
          – Uses probability distributions to model clusters, allowing soft clustering (where a point belongs to multiple clusters with different probabilities).
    5)Mean Shift:
          – Iteratively moves data points toward higher density areas to form clusters.

 Applications of Clustering:
 
      *Customer segmentation in marketing
      *Image segmentation in computer vision
      *Anomaly detection (e.g., fraud detection)
      *Grouping similar documents in NLP
      *Recommender systems (e.g., grouping users with similar behavior)

Why Use Clustering?

      -Helps understand data by grouping similar observations.
      -Used in pattern recognition, image segmentation, anomaly detection, and customer segmentation.
      -Reduces dimensionality and simplifies complex datasets.
